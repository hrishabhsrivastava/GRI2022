# Problem Title

Deep Learning in Astrophysics

# Description

The tentative goal of this project is to predict the redshift of the galaxies using the available photometric data. The photometric data is available for a
very narrow band. The neural network will train itself on the available spectroscopic data, and will predict the same for the photometric data.

# Learning Series

## Machine Learning

The initial project started with a basic learning of all the basic ML algorithms.
